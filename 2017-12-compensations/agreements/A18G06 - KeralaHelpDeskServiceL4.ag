          80% of the Level 4 Incidents at each site should be resolved within 6 hours from the time a call is received / logged whichever is earlier. The maximum resolution time for any incident of this nature shall not exceed 12 hours. This service level will be measured on basis for each examination center site. If the performance in a total examination process period for an examination center or site falls below the minimum service level, it will be treated as one (1) instance. The total number of instances for the period will be the cumulative number of instances across the process time across all sites in the total examinations period of a particular semester. Average number of instances per process = (Total number of instances during the examinations period) / 6
