          credits Five percent (5%) of the Service Fees for each 30 minutes of Cloud Database Instance unavailability, 
          after the first 0.1% (equivalent to 43.2 minutes in months of 30 days) of unavailability during the month, 
          up to one hundred percent (100%) of the Service Fees. You shall not be entitled to a credit if (i) the event 
          giving rise to the credit would not have occurred but for the resizing any Cloud Database Instance(s) upon 
          your instructions (including by increasing or decreasing the amount of storage or compute resources 
          dedicated to a given Cloud Database Instance), or (ii) where the applicable Cloud Database Instance(s) are root enabled.
          The SLO above is using rounding minutes... 43.2 (rounded to 43), that is the 0.1%.
