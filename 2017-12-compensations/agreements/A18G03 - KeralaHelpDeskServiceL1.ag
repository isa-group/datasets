          for any incident of this nature shall not exceed 1 hour. This service
          level will be measured on basis for each examination center site. If
          the performance in a total examination process period for an
          examination center or site falls below the minimum service level, it
          will be treated as one (1) instance. The total number of instances for

          particular semester. Average number of instances per process = (Total
          number of instances during the examinations period) / 6
